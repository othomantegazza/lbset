# R at the BAR

(cit. Vito Latrofa)

## Description

Let's break the ice with the R language with a small hands-on session. 

While we wait for pizza we will load a real life dataset into R, perform some simple manipulation on it, and explore its content with plots.

Afterwards, when pizza arrives, I'll showcase wider ideas of what you can do with R.
